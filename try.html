    <p>When his legs were heavy with pollen and his belly was full of nectar, Buzz knew it was time to go home. He flew back to the hive, buzzing happily along the way.<br/> As he entered the hive, he gave a little dance to tell the other bees about his big adventure.

    <p>The other bees were impressed. They watched as Buzz carefully deposited his pollen and nectar into the honeycomb. Together, they worked hard to turn the nectar into <br/>delicious honey. When the honey was finally ready, Buzz was so proud. He had done it! He had made the sweetest honey in the whole hive.</p>
